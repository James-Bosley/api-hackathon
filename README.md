# MyCalorieMate

This app was produced during a 24hr hackathon as part of my bootcamp at BrainStation. The learning objective was to solidify understanding of Web APIs and DOM manipulation methods, implementing both in a project with some consideration to UX design and purposeful functionality.

MyCalorieMate uses a natural language search API provided by [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api), which returns an estimated calorie impact of either food consumed or exercise undertaken. This allows the app to calculate a users total calorie consumption and usage thoughout a day with the ambition of enabling them to maintain a caloire defecit in the aim of weight loss.

Additional functionality allows users to remove listed items where they either have made a mistake or feel the app has misjudged their input. This app also uses the localstorage API to persist session data across visits.
